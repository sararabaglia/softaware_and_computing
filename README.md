# CutFlows

These script can be used to analyse data generated by SusySkimMaker with CutFlows method used by ATLAS collaboration and with Boost Decision Tree (BDT) performed by TMVA.

CutFlows print on txt file the result of each cut and the value of Signal over Background ratio (S/B)
TMVA produces a root file with the results of the BDT and plot on a Canvas the ROC curve

It's possible run the whole program that perform the analysis of three different hypothesis for the signal with respect all types of background (it can take many hours).
It's possible run only a Demo that perform the analysis of one signal and one type of background (few minutes).

# Version

The program was tested with the version of root 6.20.06 and the version of python 2.7.16

# Run

Analysis can be generated using the script master.py. It runs in sequence the CutFlows (myCutFlow.py) and the BDT (tmva_cut.C)

To execute the program:

'''python master.py

program asks you if you want run the simulation or the whole program of the CutFlow

program asks you if you want run also the TMVA part'''


All programs and root files for Demo can be downloaded from the following link (https://github.com/sararabaglia/software_and_computing.git)
